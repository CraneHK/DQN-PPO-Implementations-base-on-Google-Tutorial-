# DQN-PPO-Implementations-base-on-Google-Tutorial-
This project tries to solve problems in famous Google RL tutorials. 
Here are the links: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GACvZZSa_AcyB0byiDeUfLa6FcKgRM05?usp=sharing#scrollTo=dTLwkFYWBNDJ and https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UkOl8n1fwm1SbWIHgEUWXdkNlE5GUBoG?usp=sharing.
For DQN, we want to: (1) understand how deep reinforcement learning works when interacting with the pixel-level information of an environment and (2) implement a value-based algorithm to train an RL agent.
For PPO, we want to build PPO from scratch to solve a continuous control problem, i.e. pendulum-v1 in gym.
